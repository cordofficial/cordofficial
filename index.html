                <p><h1 id="proh1">Introduction to Computer Programming:</h1> <br />
Programming is a sequence of instructions written in a proper language through which the computer can understand and solve the problem given to it. It is the method by which the whole computing process is directed and controlled. Preparing a program for the computer is known as “programming”.
                <br />
A program should be recorded on a proper medium which the computer can process. Usually punched cards are used for this purpose. Each computer can understand one language which is known as “machine language”.
<br />
Machine language contains use of numeral codes and each computer has its own machine language. It is very difficult to write a program in this language. To obliterate this difficulty, some other languages have been developed.
These can be grouped into following two categories:
A machine oriented language can only be used on a computer for which it has been designed. This language contains alphabetic codes, which are known as unmemoric codes. So, it is easier to remember unmemoric codes than numeric codes and it is easier to write a program in this language.
A machine oriented language is oriented to a particular computer and not oriented to a particular problem. To avoid this difficulty, problem oriented languages have been developed. It is easier to write programs in these languages. These are also known as high level languages.
<br />
These languages are also to be translated before execution. The program used for translation in this case is known as ‘computer program’. It is a standard program written and supplied by the computer manufacturers for doing translation job.
<br />
It is a program which translates program in a language other than the machine code of a specific computer into instructions which a computer can obey. Because of this, language barrier between men and computer is broken down.
<br />
Some problem oriented languages are:
<br />
FORTRAN (Formula Translation)
<br />
ALGOL (Algorithmic Language)
<br />
COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language)
<br />
BASIC (Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) 
and many more.........
                <br />
Out of all FORTRAN is the most common programming language available on almost all the computer systems.</p>
