            <h1 class="proh1">Introduction to Computer Programming:</h1>    <p>  <br />
Programming is a sequence of instructions written in a proper language through which the computer can understand and solve the problem given to it. It is the method by which the whole computing process is directed and controlled. Preparing a program for the computer is known as “programming”.
                <br />
A program should be recorded on a proper medium which the computer can process. Usually punched cards are used for this purpose. Each computer can understand one language which is known as “machine language”.
<br />
Machine language contains use of numeral codes and each computer has its own machine language. It is very difficult to write a program in this language. To obliterate this difficulty, some other languages have been developed.
These can be grouped into following two categories:
A machine oriented language can only be used on a computer for which it has been designed. This language contains alphabetic codes, which are known as unmemoric codes. So, it is easier to remember unmemoric codes than numeric codes and it is easier to write a program in this language.
A machine oriented language is oriented to a particular computer and not oriented to a particular problem. To avoid this difficulty, problem oriented languages have been developed. It is easier to write programs in these languages. These are also known as high level languages.
<br />
These languages are also to be translated before execution. The program used for translation in this case is known as ‘computer program’. It is a standard program written and supplied by the computer manufacturers for doing translation job.
<br />
It is a program which translates program in a language other than the machine code of a specific computer into instructions which a computer can obey. Because of this, language barrier between men and computer is broken down.
<br />
Some problem oriented languages are:
<br />
FORTRAN (Formula Translation)
<br />
ALGOL (Algorithmic Language)
<br />
COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language)
<br />
BASIC (Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)
and many more.........
                <br />
Out of all FORTRAN is the most common programming language available on almost all the computer systems.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="whatsprogramming">
                <h1 class="proh1">Standard Programs:</h1> <br />
                <p>
The computer manufacturers, as a matter of sales strategy, supply readymade programs without additional charge which are common to many users. Such programs are known as standard programs because they are designed in a standard way for applications and can be used by many users.
<br />
Such programs are becoming popular because of increased co-operation between the program designers and the prospective users.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="whatsprogramming">
            <h1 class="proh1">Debugging of Computer Programs:</h1>
                <br />
            <p>
Very few programs are accurate in the first instance. Usually there are errors in a program. The removing of these errors (i.e., bugs) is known as debugging of a program. There are two types of errors that a programmer has to deal with in a program. These errors are known as syntax errors and logical errors.
<br />
Syntax errors are the errors that violate the grammar of the computer language in which the program has been written. Logical errors are the types of errors that violate the logic of doing certain-things. For example, an item which should have been added might have been deducted.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="whatsprogramming">
            <h1 class="proh1">Distributed Data Processing (DDP):</h1>
                <br />
                <p>DDP is a system in which the computing and other resources are decentralised at different places instead of being located at just one place. The places at which computers are installed are inter-connected.
<br />
In this system, there is some form of communication linkage between locations where the computer resources and users are situated. A manufacturing or trading or service organisation like banking can successfully make use of distributed data processing system.
<br>
                </p>
                <h1 class="proh1">Internet:</h1>
<p>
Any database situated in any corner of the world can be linked through the internet. Internet refers to network of different networks. The most important advantage of internet is the accessibility to information available anywhere in the world.
<br />
Every organisation or individual using personal computer can create a web site in the internet and keep any sort of information on the web site. This information is accessible from anywhere in the world using computers.
<br />
Another advantage of internet is e-mail. E-mail is helpful in faster, better and cheaper communication across the world. Internet is also being used as a medium through which trade and aids to trade are carried out.
<br />
                </p>
                <h1 class="proh1">Intranet:</h1>
<p>
It is an information system which facilitates communication within the organisation, among widely dispersed departments, divisions and regional locations. It provides easily accessible information and reduces documentation cost. Information searching time is also reduced.
